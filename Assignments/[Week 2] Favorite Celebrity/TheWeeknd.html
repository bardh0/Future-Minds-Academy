        The Weeknd, byname of Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, (born February 16, 1990,
        Toronto, Ontario, Canada), Canadian rhythm-and-blues singer and
        songwriter who was perhaps best known for his explicit songs about sex
        and drugs, many of which were autobiographical, and for his soaring
        falsetto and its singular tremolo.The Weeknd subsequently asked his
        record company for help in crafting songs. The outcome was a
        professional relationship with the hit-making Swedish producer Max
        Martin and a duet with pop star Ariana Grande, “Love Me Harder.” The
        song, released in 2014, reached the top 10. The Weeknd's next three hit
        singles, “Earned It,” “The Hills,” and “Can't Feel My Face,” were
        featured on Beauty Behind the Madness (2015). In 2016 The Weeknd won
        Canada's Juno Award for artist of the year for the second consecutive
        year, as well as four other Junos, including album of the year. He also
        won Grammy Awards for best R&B performance for “Earned It,” and Beauty
        Behind the Madness took the award for best urban contemporary album. In
        addition, “Earned It,” which was included on the sound track of the film
        Fifty Shades of Grey (2015), was nominated for an Academy Award in 2016.
