    <h1>BMW M5 CS</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The BMW M5 CS is an exceptional high-performance model with a unique
      combination of power, driving dynamics, exclusivity and emotional design.
      As a four-door sedan, it can be used in all situations and is at the same
      time predestined for fast laps on racetracks like the Nürburgring
      Nordschleife, on which the BMW M engineers did the fine tuning for their
      suspension set-up. Maximum grip is provided by the standard,
      high-performance Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres, 275/35 at the front and
      285/35 at the rear, which have been specially matched to the BMW M5 CS.

    <h1><i>AN HISTORIC ABBREVIATION</i></h1>
    <p>
      The letters CS have a long tradition at BMW and BMW M. Many fans will know
      the designation from sports coupés like the BMW 3.0 CS, the 3.0 CSi or the
      legendary 3.0 CSL competition touring cars from the 1970s. Back then, the
      abbreviation stood for “Coupé Sport”. In the meantime, CS is the symbol
      for “Competition Sport”, the designation for exclusive BMW M GmbH models
      with absolute racetrack suitability. The BMW M2 CS, the M3 CS and M4 CS
      are a part of this tradition. With the BMW M5 CS, the successful
      high-performance limousine now also gets an exclusive “Competition Sport”
      version for extraordinary driving experiences.
