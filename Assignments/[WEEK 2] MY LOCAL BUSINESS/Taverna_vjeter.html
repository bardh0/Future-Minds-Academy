      From the outside it looks enchanting, beautiful and peaceful. Clay bricks
      and intricate wooden carvings make up most of the building's outer
      structure. It's impossible to see through the stained glass windows, but
      the music and songs from within can be felt outside. As you enter the
      tavern through the decorated, wooden door, you're welcomed by the smell of
      alcohol and a pleasant atmosphere. The bartender is busy, but still
      manages to welcome you with a short wave. It's as enchanting inside as it
      is on the outside. Hardwooden beams support the upper floor and the lights
      attached to them. The walls are packed with rows of painted portraits. You
      recognize the bartender on one of them, so the others must be either
      friends, family or previous owners.. The tavern itself is packed. Locals
      seem to be the primary clientele here, which could be seen as the best
      sign you can get. Several long tables are occupied by, what seems to be
      entire families, all enjoying the food, drinks and company of each other.
      The other, smaller tables are also occupied by people who clearly enjoy
      each other's company, though they seem to be strangers who have met here.
      Even most of the stools at the bar are occupied, though nobody seems to
      mind more company. You did hear rumors about this tavern, supposedly it's
      famous for something, but you can't remember what for. Though judging by
      the amount of cups, tankards and glasses on the table, it's probably the
      fine alcoholic drinks. You manage to find a seat and prepare for what will
      undoubtedbly be a great evening.
