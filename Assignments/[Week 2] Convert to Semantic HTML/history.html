        <p>Austin hasn't always been the bustling city that it is today. This gentle bend in the Colorado River had many
            residents and visitors long before the first cornerstone was laid.</p>

        <p> For hundreds of years, nomadic tribes of Tonkawas, Comanches, and Lipan Apaches camped and hunted along the
            creeks,
            including what is now known as Barton Springs. In the late 1700s, the Spanish set up temporary missions in
            the
            area.
            In the 1830s the first permanent Anglo settlers arrived and called their village Waterloo.</p>

        <h2>What happened in 1839?</h2>
        <p>In 1839, tiny Waterloo was chosen to be the capital of the new Republic of Texas. A new city was built
            quickly in
            the wilderness, and was named after Stephen F. Austin, "the father of Texas." Judge Edwin Waller, who was
            later
            to become the city's first mayor, surveyed the site and laid out a street plan that has survived largely
            intact
            to this day. In October 1839, the entire government of the Republic arrived from Houston in oxcarts.By the
            next
            January, the town's population had swollen to 856 people.The new town plan included a hilltop site for a
            capitol
            building looking down toward the Colorado River from the head of a broad Congress Avenue. "The Avenue" and
            Pecan
            Street (now 6th Street) have remained Austin's principal business streets for the 150 years since. After
            Texas
            was annexed by the United States in 1845, it took two statewide elections to keep Austin the capital city.
